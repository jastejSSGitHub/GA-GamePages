`Be part of an ever-evolving multiplayer experience spread across three main modes, each with a unique play approach, rewards to unlock and things to discover. 

Join your friends in an immense elimination match and fight to be the last ones standing in Battle Royale, collaborate to craft your own dream Fortnite world in Creative mode or band together with up to three friends to fend off hordes of monsters in Save the World.

Every mode evolves naturally with weekly updates that add or remove weapons or introduce new events and seasonal updates that reshape the game world, add new rewards to unlock or brand-new in-game features.

Only one rule matters: the more you play, the more you earn.

Dive into a free-to-play, 100-player battle royale experience that gets bigger and even wilder with every new season.

Explore large, destructible environments where no two games are ever the same and build huge forts, hunt down loot and team up with friends to earn your Victory Royale.
